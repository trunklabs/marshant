New visual identity and enhanced authentication experience

## Web (Minor)

We've completely refreshed the Marshant experience with a new logo and redesigned interface. The authentication flow has been rebuilt from the ground up with better-auth integration, providing a more secure and streamlined sign-in experience. The dashboard now features an improved layout with better project and flag management, new data visualization components, and a more intuitive navigation system. Additional enhancements include theme switching support, new UI components for better data tables, and an overall modernized look and feel.

## Core (Patch)

Improved validation logic for feature gate configurations to ensure more reliable flag evaluations.
